1/  install apache tomcat
        http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
    
2/  prepare web application for deployment:
        copy .war file to C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-7.0.35\webapps\
    
3/  set environment variable for JAVA eg
        ~$ set JRE_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jre7

4/  Using a keystore file for https connections.
    Generate a keystore using the java keystore generator, alternatively, use the ".keystore" file provided:
        Real deployment would get a certificate from a trusted authority, so this is just a self signed keystore.
        Enter at the cmd prompt:
        %JAVA_HOME%\bin\keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA \ -keystore C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-7.0.35\
        
        Either create or copy the .keystore file to the tomcat base directory or a location which corresponds
        to the keyStoreFile attribute of the connecter element in tomcat's server.xml described below

    4.1/ edit the tomcat config file:
        C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-7.0.35\conf\server.xml

        Find the commented out reference to a connector port 8443 (near line 90 depending on version) and insert:

    <Connector 
            port="8443" maxThreads="200" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
            scheme="https" secure="true" SSLEnabled="true"
            keystoreFile="${catalina.base}/.keystore" keystorePass="changeit"
            clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />

        note the password you are asked for by the java keytool and the one in the server.xml must match
        - "changeit" is default

5/  run tomcat:
        ~$ C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-7.0.35\bin\catalina run
        on startup the .war will be deployed

6/  install mySQL server
        http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

        commands to initialize database*:
        
            drop database team19;
            CREATE DATABASE team19 CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
            use team19
            source C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-7.0.35\webapps\team19\team19.sql
            source C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-7.0.35\webapps\team19\team19data.sql
        *alter paths as required
    
6/  to run via reverse proxy, required for visibility to use paypal:
        install python
            http://www.python.org/download/
        get pagekite.py
            http://pagekite.net/downloads/
            requires no install can be run from desktop
                run pagekite client, double click pagekite.py or from command promt:
                $ pagekite.py --signup
                    first time startup asks for email etc, to reserve a domain name and bandwidth,
                    free for 30 days, does not require activation for 10 days, so ignore.
                default setup exposes localhost:80, since tomcat listens on port 8080,
                halt the pagekite client (ctrl-c) and enter
                $ pagekite.py 8080 *SOMEURL.pagekite.me
                    *may be reserved, choose a unique name, in development we used team19summer.pagekite.me
                if tomcat is running, the application should now be accessible at:
                    SOMEURL.pagekite.me/team19/pages/
                    or
                    SOMEURL.pagekite.me/team19/pages/admmin
                    for admin access.

7/  Properties for application configuration are  stored in the application
root folder in the file named setup.txt.
    This file stores urls and credentials for access to the database,
the business name for identifying the recipient of paypal transactions,
urls and credentials for utilising the mailjet cloud smtp service.
Also note that a paypal sandbox account for test transactions has been
setup for convenience, details below:

paypal sandbox a/c
    email: team19test@test.com
    pswrd: test1test
