1/ install cygwin, this is for running posix environment unix apps on windows:
create C:\cygwin\ and download http://cygwin.com/setup.exe
@ cmd prompt C:\cygwin run:
setup.exe -q -P aspell-en,cron,ctags,exim,gcc-g++,inetutils,make,mingw-runtime,ncurses,openssh,patch,perl,python,ruby,rxvt,subversion,vim
(  actually you might only need:
      setup.exe -q -P gcc-g++,make,openssh,python,ruby
  but I haven't figured out the min requirments, just get the lot )

2/ Install localtunnel client, this service provides an reverse SSH tunnel from their public domain, see http://progrium.com/localtunnel/

Install localtunnel by running (in the cygwin terminal): 
    gem install localtunnel 
Generate a public/private key by running:
    ssh-keygen 
When it prompts you for a file to save, enter nothing and press enter. 
It will put the file into your home folder. ‘~/.ssh’ and the path to the file is 
    ‘~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub’ by default.

3/  Make note of where your public key is saved. Run localtunnel for the first time by running 
    localtunnel -k {Path_To_Your_Public_Key} {PORT_NUMBER}
eg: localtunnel -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 8080 

This will upload your public key to localtunnel and respond with something like
    "This localtunnel service is brought to you by Twilio.
    Port 8080 is now publicly accessible from http://3ivy.localtunnel.com ..."

From then on, you can just run localtunnel 8080 And get a temporary public URL for the local app.
Unfortunately the domain prefix will be different each time ... blah blah problems ... blah blah fixable
I still need to do a little more to get relative urls for css to use the right domain, later today...
